# C# Applications

- .NET Framework
	- Basic Building Blocks
		- Comman Language Specifications (CLS)
			- Set of Rules for .NET Languages 
			- e.g.
				- Syntaxes
				- Expressions MUST be LHS =  RHS
					- Consider Using TypeCasting for Data
				- If a class and its method is used in Source-Code, then the code  file MUST use the namespace in which that class is Present
			- The Language Specific Compilaters
				- C# Compiler
				- VB.NET Compiler
				- F#
		- Common Type System (CTS)
			- Used o Define all Types (aka Data Types) those are used to Store Data
			- Used by CLS
			- The 'Type' is the Higest Level Type-Declaration, under the 'System' Namespace
				- System.Type
					- This will be used to detech which type of data can be stored in a variable
				- The System.Object, is a highest-level data types
# Data Types
- Numeric
	- int, unint (4 bytes), System.Int32, System.UInt32 (CTS Types)
	- short, ushort (2 bytes), System.Int16, System.UInt16 (CTS Types)
	- byte, (1 byte), System.Byte (CTS Types)
	- long, ulong (8 bytes), System.Int64, System.UInt64 (CTS Types)
	- float (4 bytes),  System.Float32 (CTS Types)
	- double (8 bytes), System.Float64 (CTS Types)
	- decimal, (16 bytes), System.decimal  (CTS Types)
- Text
	- char, 2 bytes, System.Char
	- string, length of the string * 2 , System.String
- Boolean
	- bool
- Date
	- date, System.DateTime
- Collection
	- Types of In-Memory Data Collection
			
		- Framework Class Library (FCL)
			- Contains Standard Libraries with predefined set of classses grouped under 'Namespaces'
			- We use these classes while developing application by writing the code
			- The 'System' the highest level namespace
				- System.dll
			- System.Data, For Database
			- System.Collections, For In-Memory Data Mgmt
			- System.Web, for Web Apps
			- System.IO for Files
			- ..... an so on
- Input and Output Types (aka Classes)
	- System.Console
		- Class for Input/Output for Console Apps
		- Methods
			- Output
				- Write(), Print a string 
				- WriteLine(), print string on new line
			- Input
				- Read(), Read a Current String
				- ReadLine(), Read a  Line
				- ReadKey(), read any key
# Casting of Types
	- This is required in following cases
		- The RHS is generating a result which is not in the range of the LHS type 
			- If RHS returns decimal/long/string, then it cannot be stored into the integer
		- The RHS retuen value which does not match with the LHS type
			- if RHS return string and LHS is int/long/ etc. then better cast it
	- Casting Class
		- The 'Convert' class
		- Methods
			- ToInt32(), ToDecimal(), ToFloat(), ToDouble(), etc
# Code Compilation
- C# Source Code ----> Language Specific Compiler (C# Compiler)----> Generate A Compiled Output
	- Outpt Types from the Cource Code
		- .exe
		- .dll
# Debugging
	- F9, to apply breakpoint on the code so that the debugging can start
	- F11, the step into, to debug each line including a method call i.e. all lines for the method
	- F10, the strp over,  to debug each line by excluding method lines
# Asssembly
	- Compiled Output from the .NET Application
	- The Group of classes in the Program
	- The Output which is used for distribution to other application (.dll) or the self executable application itself (.exe)
		- The portable executable file (.PE), means can be shared across diveds on one machine and on other machines and will be executed if the targtt machine contains .NET Framework 
	- The Intermidiate Language Dis-Assembler
		- Installed when the .NET Frwk is installed
		- C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v10.0A\bin\NETFX 4.8 Tools\ildasm.exe
# C# Programming
- Fundamentals
	- Code Statements
	- Methods
		- Block of Re-Usable Statements		
			- One-Way Methods
				- Does not return anything
				- May Accepts Input Parameters
			- Two-Way Methods
				- Method that retuns a value or a parameter
				- May Accepts Input Parameters 
	- Conditional Statements
	- Type Manipulations
		- String Data Type
			- High-Level Language Agonostic Data Type
			- Powerfull because, it can store large stream of characters in it
			- The 'string' as declaration of the Type 'System.String'
			- This is a Reference Type
			- This is an Array of Characters
				- Alphabet
				- Numeric Characters
				- Special Chaarcters
			- Since this is an Array, we can use the Loops aka Iteration to read data from String
				- for..loop
				- while..loop
				- do..while
				- Very Important
					- for..each loop
			- Being a Reference type is has following
				- Property
					- length
				- Methods
					- ToUpper()
					- ToLower()
					- SubStr()
	- Collection Foundation
		- Arrays
			- System.Array is a Type (aka class)
			- Any array declaration of any datatype will be a default instance of array class
			- The 'Length' is a property
			- Sort(), IndexOf(), LastIndexOf(), ect.
	- Collection Framework
		- In-Memory Data Store Classes
		- Practices to be followed while using the Collections 		
	- Object Oriented Programming
		- Applied OOPs
		- Classes
		- Access Specifier, Access Modifiers
		- Inheritence
		- Polymorphism
