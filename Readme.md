# C# Applications

- .NET Framework
	- Basic Building Blocks
		- Comman Language Specifications (CLS)
			- Set of Rules for .NET Languages 
			- e.g.
				- Syntaxes
				- Expressions MUST be LHS =  RHS
					- Consider Using TypeCasting for Data
				- If a class and its method is used in Source-Code, then the code  file MUST use the namespace in which that class is Present
			- The Language Specific Compilaters
				- C# Compiler
				- VB.NET Compiler
				- F#
		- Common Type System (CTS)
			- Used o Define all Types (aka Data Types) those are used to Store Data
			- Used by CLS
			- The 'Type' is the Higest Level Type-Declaration, under the 'System' Namespace
				- System.Type
					- This will be used to detech which type of data can be stored in a variable
				- The System.Object, is a highest-level data types
# Data Types
- Numeric
	- int, unint (4 bytes), System.Int32, System.UInt32 (CTS Types)
	- short, ushort (2 bytes), System.Int16, System.UInt16 (CTS Types)
	- byte, (1 byte), System.Byte (CTS Types)
	- long, ulong (8 bytes), System.Int64, System.UInt64 (CTS Types)
	- float (4 bytes),  System.Float32 (CTS Types)
	- double (8 bytes), System.Float64 (CTS Types)
	- decimal, (16 bytes), System.decimal  (CTS Types)
- Text
	- char, 2 bytes, System.Char
	- string, length of the string * 2 , System.String
- Boolean
	- bool
- Date
	- date, System.DateTime
- Collection
	- Types of In-Memory Data Collection
			
		- Framework Class Library (FCL)
			- Contains Standard Libraries with predefined set of classses grouped under 'Namespaces'
			- We use these classes while developing application by writing the code
			- The 'System' the highest level namespace
				- System.dll
			- System.Data, For Database
			- System.Collections, For In-Memory Data Mgmt
			- System.Web, for Web Apps
			- System.IO for Files
			- ..... an so on
- Input and Output Types (aka Classes)
	- System.Console
		- Class for Input/Output for Console Apps
		- Methods
			- Output
				- Write(), Print a string 
				- WriteLine(), print string on new line
			- Input
				- Read(), Read a Current String
				- ReadLine(), Read a  Line
				- ReadKey(), read any key
# Casting of Types
	- This is required in following cases
		- The RHS is generating a result which is not in the range of the LHS type 
			- If RHS returns decimal/long/string, then it cannot be stored into the integer
		- The RHS retuen value which does not match with the LHS type
			- if RHS return string and LHS is int/long/ etc. then better cast it
	- Casting Class
		- The 'Convert' class
		- Methods
			- ToInt32(), ToDecimal(), ToFloat(), ToDouble(), etc
# Code Compilation
- C# Source Code ----> Language Specific Compiler (C# Compiler)----> Generate A Compiled Output
	- Outpt Types from the Cource Code
		- .exe
		- .dll
# Debugging
	- F9, to apply breakpoint on the code so that the debugging can start
	- F11, the step into, to debug each line including a method call i.e. all lines for the method
	- F10, the strp over,  to debug each line by excluding method lines
# Asssembly
	- Compiled Output from the .NET Application
	- The Group of classes in the Program
	- The Output which is used for distribution to other application (.dll) or the self executable application itself (.exe)
		- The portable executable file (.PE), means can be shared across diveds on one machine and on other machines and will be executed if the targtt machine contains .NET Framework 
	- The Intermidiate Language Dis-Assembler
		- Installed when the .NET Frwk is installed
		- C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v10.0A\bin\NETFX 4.8 Tools\ildasm.exe
# C# Programming
- Fundamentals
	- Code Statements
	- Methods
		- Block of Re-Usable Statements		
			- One-Way Methods
				- Does not return anything
				- May Accepts Input Parameters
			- Two-Way Methods
				- Method that retuns a value or a parameter
				- May Accepts Input Parameters 
	- Conditional Statements
	- Type Manipulations
		- String Data Type
			- High-Level Language Agonostic Data Type
			- Powerfull because, it can store large stream of characters in it
			- The 'string' as declaration of the Type 'System.String'
			- This is a Reference Type
			- TO Initialize a string to 0 as length use 'string.Empty' instead of ""
			- This is an Array of Characters
				- Alphabet
				- Numeric Characters
				- Special Chaarcters
			- Since this is an Array, we can use the Loops aka Iteration to read data from String
				- for..loop
				- while..loop
				- do..while
				- Very Important
					- for..each loop
			- Being a Reference type is has following
				- Property
					- length
				- Methods
					- ToUpper()
					- ToLower()
					- SubStr()
	- Collection Foundation
		- Arrays
			- System.Array is a Type (aka class)
			- Any array declaration of any datatype will be a default instance of array class
			- The 'Length' is a property
			- Sort(), IndexOf(), LastIndexOf(), ect.
	- Collection Framework
		- In-Memory Data Store Classes
			-  USe Collections to Store UBound Data (Unlimitted data)
				- ArrayList
				- Queue
				- Stack
				- SortedList
			- Each Entry in collection is stored as 'object'
			- To Read an entry from collection for a specific type, the CLR has to read a type  first and then read its value, this is known as 'UnBoxing' and this takes 2-CPU cycles for each entry in the class (this reduces performance)
		- Practices to be followed while using the Collections
	- Using Scalable Coding using Reference Types
		- The 'ref'
			- Receive the Reference of the Variable being processed
			- Make sure that the variable is initialized before its reference passed to the method
		- The 'out'
			- Like Ref, used to pass the reference of actual parameter to a method, but the actual parameter need not have any initial value 
	- Object Oriented Programming
		- Applied OOPs
		- Classes
			- Members
				- Data Members (Generally Private to class)
				- Smart Fields aka Properties
					- A public get/set encapsulation over the Private Data Members
					- The property can immedialy validate the private member in its 'set' method section
						- The 'set' will be called when a value is assigned to a property
						- The 'get' will be called when the value is read from the Property
					- C# 3.0, Auto-Implmented Properties
						- They are used while creating Entity-Class OR DTO
						- The C# Compiler creates Private members implicitly for  Auto-Implemented Properties 
			- Methods
				- Behaviors aka Logic defined Around Members
		- Access Specifier
			- Rules or Guidelines for defining access of members and methods of the class inside the application
			- private : Within the declaring class

			- protected: WIthin the declarting class and its base class

			- public: Across all callers / users of the class

			- internal: Within the namespace where the declaing class is present  (aka Public to namespace)

			- protected internal: Like internal and also accessible in the derived class of other namespace

		- Access Modifiers
			- Behavior applied to class and its members
			- abstract: If applied tol the class then the class MUST be inherited and if applied to the method then the method MUST be Overriden by the deribed class. The abstract method does not have any implementation.

			- sealed: If applied on the class then class cannot be inherited and if applied on the method then the method cannot be overriden.

			- virtual: Applied on the method. Then the method has an implementation and this cane be overidden by the derived class or the derived class may use the method implementation of base as it it.

			- overrides: Used by the method from the derived class to override the base class abstract as well as virtual methods

			- new: Applied on the method of the deribed class to 'hide' the matching method of the base class

			- static: The member is accessed using the class name

		- Classes Designing Strategy
			- IN the system based on the use of the class define it
			- e.g.
				- If the class is used to pass data across various methods, then define the class as 'Entity Class' OR 'Data Transfer Object (DTO)' OR 'Value Object (VO)'.
				- If the class is used for defining behavior  (aka logic) then make its containing public/private/protected/internal/protected internal/static member methods
				    
		- Inheritence
			- A Mechanism of Deriving a Specific Class Type from the General Class Type
			- The Derived Type has access to all Protected and Public Memebrs of the Base Type
			- Specific to .NET Programming Languages	
				- 'Only One-Base class is possible to Derive class'
			- Derivation Types aka Types of Inheritence
				- Single Inheritence
					- One base class has onbe Derive class
						- class Base {}
						- class Derive: Base{}
				- Heirarchical Inheritence
					- Multiple Classes are derived from One Base class
					- class Base {}
					- class Derive1:Base{}
					- class Derive2:Base {}
				- Multi-Level Inheritence
					- The derive class act as a Base class for other derived class 
					- class Base{}
					- class Derive1:Base {}
					- class Derive2:Derive1{}
			- Advantages
				- Reduce even in some cases eliminate repetation
				- Completly Avoid Redundancies
				- In a Specific Derived class, the derive class can be decorated with the additional Members (Properties and Methods) 
			- Observations while working with Inheritence
				- If the Derive class want to extend the base class methods (Implementation), then make the base class as an 'abstract' and follow below rules for Writing Methods in base class
					- If the Derive class intends to write complete new implementation for the method in base class, then the base class method MUST be 'abstract' and the derve class will 'override' it.
					- If the Derive class want to use the base class method implementation as-it-is or want to enhance the implementation of the base class method then make the base class method as 'virtual' and let the derive class decide wheather to override that method with new implementation or use it as-it-is 
				- If the base class which is having 'abstract' methods then the derive class MUST override all abstract methods from the base class otherwise the derive class will have error, to eliminate these errors the deriver class either modifed as 'abstract class' or teh derive class MUST override all abstract methods of the base class 
				- The Base Class Object Can be replaced by the derive class object but vice-versa is not suppored 

				- Method Overloading, Not a Polymorphism
					- Having Same Methods in Base and Derive class with
						- Same Name
							- M1();
							- M1(int x); Overloading
						- Different in Parameter Number
							- M1(int x,int y);
							- M1(int x,int y, iny z);
						- Same in Parameter Numbers but different in Types of parameter
							- M1(int x, string s);
							- M1(int x, int y);
						- Same in Parameter number but differnt Type and Different Order of parameters
							- M1(int x, string s);
							- M1(string s, int x);
				- The use of Constctors Across Base amd Derived Classes
					- The derive class ctor invoke the base class ctor using 'base()' and pass patrameters to base class ctor if the base class has Parameterized ctor
				- What if the Base and Derive classes wants  Same methods with Same Signeture, but no Overaloding?
					- Either make the base class as 'virtual' or 'abstract' (Only for Abstratc base class) and let the derive class override it
					- OR Let the Derive class shodow the base class method using 'new' keyword, known as 'shadowing'
						- The derive class instance ignore the base class method completly
						- Real Word: Needed if the base class is not available for modification (means the code is not present with you)

		- Polymorphism
		- Communication Across Object 
			- Interfaces
				- Share common method standards across classes
				- A Class can implement one-or-more interfaces
				- When a class implement interface, then the class MUSt implement all methods from interface
				- A Class can implement methods from interfaces as Implicit or Explicit
					- In implicit implementation, the class has ownership of all methods and these are invoked using an instance of the class
					- In explict implementation, the class contains definition for all methods but these are owne by the interface and hence these methods are invoked using the Interface reference and not using an instance of the class
				- A Class can derive fropm one-classs and can implement multiple interfaces, BUT THIS IS NOT MULTIPLE INHERITENCE 
			- Delegate
				- It is a Type that hides an implementation of the method by using the address of the method
				- The System.Delegate is a Type
				- By Concept
					- The delegate is used to invoke the method with its reference
					- To execute a method with its reference, the signeture of delegate MUST match with the signeture of the method
					- The delegate MUST be declared at namespace-level so that all classes under that namespace can use the delegate
				- Additional uses of delegates apart from invoking the method
					- Used to declare an event
					- Used to execute a method 'Ansynchronously'
						- This internally uses 'Thraeding'
						- BegingInvoke(), To Start Execution, this returns IAsyncResult interface, this monitor the async execution.
							- IAsyncResult as 'IsCompleted' property, that indicates if the thread has complete its execution
						- EndInvoke(IAsyncResult)
							- Represents that the Thread has done the job and the result is returned
				- A Delegate for Anonymous Method
					- The delegate directly contains an expression as implmentation
					- This will be directly Compoled as Binary and executed by the Runtime with Performance benefits
				- What if the Delegate is passed as Input parameter to a method?
					- Then pass the 'Lambda Expression' as input parameter to a method
					- C# 3.0
						- e.g.
							- Method(handler)
								- The handler is delegate declared as follows
									- delegate double handler(double x, double y);
							- Pass the Lamdba Expression to Methods as follows
								- Method((x,y)=> {return x*x + 2*x*y+ y*y});
								- This Lambda will be converted into Binary as follows
									- OperanExpression class in CLR 2.0 with SP1
										- x and y
									- OperatorExpression Class
										- * and +
									- Expression Class
										- x*x + 2*x*y+ y*y
			- Event
				- A Sepcial type of delegate
				- Always declared inside the class
				- Use events for Notifications
				- The delegate which is used to declare an event MUS be having return type as 'void' (One-Way)
	
	- Generics
		- Best Use of Collections
		- They are the Templates for storing Data
		- Once the Template is given a Specific Type (Primptive Type or Custom CLR type) it will always uses the Same type throught the execution
		- The BEST REPLACEMENT FOR COLLECTIONS
			- No Boxing and UnBoxing
		- System.Collections.Generic;
			- List<T>
			- LinkedList<T>
			- Stack<T>
			- Queue<T>
			- .... and many more
		- The 'T' is a Template Parameter which can be 'typed-to' any stanadard or custome CLR Type
				- List<int> this will create a list instance only for integer values in list
				- List<string> the list instance only for string
				- List<Staff> the list imnstance only for Staff
		- BAsed on the type  for 'T', the CLR will create a copy of Generic class for the type in 'BINARY FORMAT'
	- Event Driven Programming
		- Delegates
		- Events
	- Applied C#
		- Lambdas
		- Extension Methods
			- These are  methods those are added into the existing type Sealed/abstract/Interface without modifying the source-code of the type
			- The class that contains the extension method MUST be Static
			- The methopd MUST be static
			- The First Parameter of the method MUST be the 'this' referred 'reference' of the 'class' for which this method will  act as extenion method
				- class MyClass {......}
				- Extension class will be
					- static class MyExtension { static void MyExtension(this MyClass m){....}    }
				- MyClass m = new MyClass();
				- m.MyExtension();

		- Anonymous Types
		- Languag eIntegrated Queries (LINQ)
			- A mechanism of eliminting gap between Database and Object
			- The Object is now not just a 'schema' but its is 'data' also
			- A Similar Queries like Database
			- Extension Methods for declaratibe Queries
				- Select(), Where(), OrderBy(), OrdebyDescending(), GroupBy(), Jin(), etc.
				- e.g.
					- Collection.Where(Consition as Lambda Expression)
			- Keyword for Imperative queries , similar to Database Queries
				- Keywords
					- from, select, hroup, by, order, desc, join, etc.
			- Scalar Functions
				- Sum(), Min(), Max(), Take(), Skip(), etc.
				
	- Threading
		- Multi-Threading
			- A 'Thread' Class
				- Represent a process that is to be executed either SYnchronously or Asynchronously
				- Start(), Stop(), Suspend(), Resume(), Abort(), Join(), etc.
		- Parallel Programming
			- .NET 4.0 year 2010, The CLR 4.0
				- CLR Add-On with Parallel Extensions
					- A Great wrapper over the Hardware Parallel Processing
					- Parallel
						- Ask CLR to Alocate and Manage thread internally and execute the Large Processes 
							- Parallely on Implicitly Picked threads from CLR
								- For() and ForEach()
									- USed to Process Large Collections parallely instead of sequential execution
							- Invoke the multiple Processes and intenlly execute them by Threads
								- Invoke() Method
									- Invoke multiple processes and execute them on different thread w/o creating them exolicitly
					- Task
						- A Unit of Asynchronous Programming
						- This manages the Thread internally
						- Runs Multiple Threads
						- Wait for Threads to Complete
							- Wait(): Wait for a Thread  to completes its execution, WaitAll(); Wait for All threads to complete its execution, WaitAny(): Any Specific Thread
						- Start()
							- Start a Task Explicitly
						- Task.Factory.StartNew()
							- Call a Method that uses Sub-Tasks in it
							- E.g.
								- Task.Factory.StartNew(()=>{Method1();});
								- void Methods1() {Task1.Start(), Task2.Start()......}
						- Move from-One-Thread-To-Other-Thread After completion of first thread
							- ContineWith()	
								- Helps to Jump to the Next Task when the Previous is completed
						- Challanges while working with Tasks
							- What should we do if the Method running on task want to return some data?
								- Ask the FActory to Monitor the execution and then collect datas from it and then return to main thread
								- Receive the result from the Task using 'Result' property of the Task Object 
							
			- .NEt 4.5 + and Contiue in .NET Core, .NET 5, 6
				- Asynchronous Programming
				- The 'async' and 'await' modifiers
					- 'async' applied for the method that performs Task Based Operation
					- 'await' is applied on startment to infor CLR that the current staement is executed asynchornously and return a Result after the statement is executed
				- All Mathods those ends with 'Async' word are asynchronous methods and they returns Task object
					- e.g.
						- ReadAsync(), WriteAsync(), GetAsync(), PostAsync(), etc.
	- Memeory-Management
		- For All Managed Resources, the GC is responsible to Clean them from Managed-HEAP
			- Managed Resources : All the classes those are executed within the boundary of CLR e.g. Collections, Generics, etc.
				- Block-Scopde declarations
			- For all UnManaged Resources, to clean them from Managed-Heap, The garbage collection will call the Destructor for that object (First call for GC), this will clean the allocation from the ManagedHeap, but the object reference still present in Finalization Queue (A data structure that contains entries those are waiting to be cleansed) 
				- The Garbage Collector thread will b einvoked twice to clean finalization Q

# C# Practices
1. The String Declaration MUST be either 'null' or 'string.Empty'
2. Use the Auto-Implemented Properties for the entity class
3. Instead of using Colleciton classes, use the generics
4. If the class is performing an 'Un-Managed Resource' operations, then to kill the object let the class implement an'IDisposable' interface
	- Un-Managed Resource: All the resources those provided by OS to .NET Application
		- e.g. Database Connections, File System, Socker Resources, Messaging resources (e.g. MSMQ, RabbitMQ)
5. Use Exception Handling
	- A Methodology to handle errors while CLR failed to process the code
	- try{.....}catch(Exception ex){.....} finally {........}
		- The Exception, the highgest level exception handling class
		- If try fails the catch will be executed
		- The finally will be executed irrespective of try or catch executed
		- The 'throw' keyword to throw the exception
	- Observations
		- If M1() calls M2(), an M2() throws an exception then instead of catching the exception in M2(), throw it so that M1() can catch it 
			- Exception Chaining
	- USe Exception Handling as Mandatory Practice while working with following
		- Database Operations
		- File Handling
		- Http Communication
		- Messaging

	- Dictionay<K,V>
		- USed to Store data in Key Value pair form
		- K is mostly inte, string
		- V is value can be any CLR Type
